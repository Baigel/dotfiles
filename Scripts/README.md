Please ignore these. I shall move them to their own dedicated repository at a later date. Also, I advise against running any of them. Most of them should never even had seen the light of day.

If you are tempted to run some of the spotify download scripts, I would advise against it. I have already recieved a couple of emails from Spotify telling me to stop abusing the terms of service. All you are like to achieve is getting your Spotify account banned/terminated. Seriously.
