# Overview
Here you shall find all my dot files and other configuration things. Mostly just linux stuff.

## Folder Layout
Each folder contains the corresponding file that is needed for said distro/program. Just git clone the file and place it in its required destination folder.

## Other
p.s. this repo is a bit of a mess and there is stuff very specific to me (deal with it)
