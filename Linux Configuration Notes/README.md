Please don't use these as a guide. They are just a few notes that I have taken while running a couple of different Linux distributions. I find it is easier to reproduce stuff that I have done in Linux when I write it down this is the where I do just that.

Seriously, go find an actual guide - most of this stuff is specific to how I like to setup my working environment.
